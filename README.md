<h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">Vulnerability Assessment Report</h2><br>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Overview</h2>

In this activity, you will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. You will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

<h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Scenario</h2>

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.<br>
A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.<br>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">System Description</h2>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.<br>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Scope</h2>

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from August 2023 to November 2023. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA">NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1</a> is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.<br>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Purpose</h2>

The business utilizes a server that stores user data in which there are remote workers from across the United States. The expanse attack area makes the businesses server prone to increased risk due to the overexposure. To mitigate a potential disastrous breach, we will evaluate specific areas of risk that is typical for a business of this type. In the conclusion of this assessment we will provide the business with a recommendation on the best path forward with the total risk.<br>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Risk Assessment</h2>

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | Employees with adequate access may be able to tamper with the hardware... | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Competitor | Competitor may be able to intrude upon the server access... | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Hacker | Hacker will be able to intrude on the system and obtain sensitive information... | 2 | 3 | 6 |

<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Approach</h2>

The three risks considered were hackers, competitors, and internal employees with the potential for each to have a profound impact on the operations of the business. All businesses have employees and will be exposed to internal vulnerabilities. In addition most companies will have competitors, and will have a indefinite risk as the competition works side by side or until one business falters. Ultimately all businesses are at risk for hackers, as there is nefarious intent for damaging reputations, monetary gain, or intentional disruption of operations.<br>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Remediation Strategy</h2>

Starting with utilizing the principle of least privilege, and separation of duties will help mediate the potential vulnerabilities that each of the employees can impose on the business. Utilizing security camera on premise to act as a deterrent will aid in protecting physical systems from misuse from internal employees, or potentially vendors that make their way through the premise. All systems will need to be updated to the latest software updates to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patches and not exposed to potential hackers looking for a business to breach.<br>
